The main objectives of `pacder` is to expose through the Python programming langauge the REDCap API, and enable developers to write external applications that interact with REDCap instances with the widest possible scope. These are the inflexible guidelines for contributing:

 - sources must satisfy [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/);
 - and only standard library __3.6+__ sources are acceptable at the moment.

Other than these two limitations, fixes and new features are all welcome.
